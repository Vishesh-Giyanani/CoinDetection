# CoinDetection
Capstone Project of one of my Python Online Courses.

I try to detect the amount of lose change in pictures using computervision. After the dectection I will add up all the coin values and will return the total sum of all coins.

# Process / Steps

[] Document goal of the challenge
[x] Create and set up a virtuel environment
[x] Configure IDE (my choice: VScode)
[x] get knowledge about the different coins
[x] come to grips with the use of opencv

# Ressources
>> VSCode
>> Conda Interpreter
>> Modules
>>> OpenCV
>>> Numpy


# Coin Sizes:
0.01 / 20.3 mm diameter / copper
0.02 / 25.9 mm diameter / copper
0.05 / 18 mm diameter / silver
0.10 / 24.5 mm diameter / silver
0.50 / 27.3 mm diameter / nickel // seven-sided!
1.00 / 22.5 mm diameter / gold
2.00 / 28.4 mm diameter / gold / silver
